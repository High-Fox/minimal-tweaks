**Minimal Tweaks** is a small collection of changes that simply make sense. They are __neither gameplay-breaking nor gameplay-changing__.

Some tweaks were originally suggestions found on theÂ Minecraft feedback site.

### Tweaks List
* Right clicking a torch, campfire, or lantern with soul sand/soul soil will convert it to its soul fire variant
* Strippable blocks can be stripped in a crafting table with an axe
* Concrete powder can be solidified in a crafting table with a water bucket
* The glass bottle received after drinking a potion will automatically be moved into an already existing stack of glass bottles in your inventory (if available)
* Crop seeds can be placed in flower pots
* Beacon beam effects can be turned off by shift-right clicking a beacon with an empty hand
* Using an iron block on a damaged anvil repairs it
* Chests can be opened through item frames, causing the item not to be rotated. Sneaking will use the default behaviour
* When a lead breaks a sound is played

__All tweaks can be turned on/off in the config file__
